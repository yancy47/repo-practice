	<p>I'm a suburban mother of 5... just kidding but it feels like it. I'm the 2nd eldest of 6 so if my eldest sister were to die <b>everything</b> falls on me. As the second daughter I've always been the buffer wether it be the chauffeur, therapist, caretaker, legal liaison, financial advisor, health insurance advisor, PTA volunteer, file organizer, the chef, the baker, the list goes on. As a hispanic I indeed have a very large family, you can imagine how family gatherings go. I have a very supportive awesome partner-in-crime named Nicolas who is always down for whatever is going on. I'm a very talkative person once I feel comfortable around you which will take around 5 years. Ha ha ha...gotcha ya! Nah, I'm a very chill laid back person and I'm looking forward to getting to know you all.
